Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow currently working with the [Gehlenborg Lab](http://gehlenborglab.org/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/). From 2019-2021 I was a postdoctoral associate in the [Data Intelligence for Health (DIH) Lab](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/lab/dih/dih), advised by Dr. Joon Lee. 
Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary in Canada and my MSc in Software Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology in Iran. 


My research centers on information visualization, health informatics, digital health, and social media analysis.
