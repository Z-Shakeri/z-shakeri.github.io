Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Gehlenborg Lab](http://gehlenborglab.org/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/). I earned my Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of Calgary at Calgary, Canada and my MSc in Software Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran.

<!--My work has been published in International Studies Quarterly, Conflict Management and Peace Science, and Political Science Research and Methods, among other outlets. My research explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft. I have teaching experience in both international relations and quantitative methodology.-->
