Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow currently working with the [Gehlenborg Lab](http://gehlenborglab.org/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](http://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/). From 2019-2021 I was a postdoctoral associate in health informatics at the University of Calgary in Canada, where I received my Ph.D. from. Prior to that, I received my MSc and BSc in Software Engineering from the Sharif University of Technology and Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran. 


My research centers on information visualization, health informatics, precision (public) health, digital health, and social media analysis.
