>"Ask yourself: who is the one teacher in your entire life who made the biggest difference for you--who taught you so well that you still think about him or her as your best teacher. I bet that for almost all of us, that best teacher was someone who knew you by name!"

>Kent Syverud, 1993


While at the University of Calgary, I taught the graduate machine learning, data mining, and advanced data visualization courses. I also taught the software engineering course offered to the second year undergraduate students from 2016 to 2018, where my work was recognized by the [University of Calgary GSA Excellence in Teaching Award](https://news.ucalgary.ca/news/graduate-students-association-recognizes-excellence-annual-awards-gala-0) in April 2018. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in computer science, programming languages, and software engineering.
