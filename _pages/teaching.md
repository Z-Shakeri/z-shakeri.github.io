Research plays a central role in my teaching as students improve their analytical skills and master the tools of data analysis through hands-on experience. I have taught undergraduate courses on political violence and statistical methodology. While at UNC, I taught the graduate statistics lab for Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, where my work was recognized by the Political Science Department's Earle Wallace Award for Graduate Student Teaching. I also served as a teaching assistant for courses in international relations and American politics at UNC, in addition to the ICPSR Summer Program where I was a teaching assistant for a course on Bayesian modeling in the social sciences. You can view my teaching portfolio [here](/files/pdf/teaching/Portfolio.pdf).

You can find a selection of my teaching materials, including all of the labs from Advanced Topics in Political Data Science, [here](/teaching-materials).
