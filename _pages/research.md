In this research, I developed a multicountry, longitudinal, and fully Labelled digital public health dataset of tweets that originated in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), or the United States (US) between November 28$^{th}$ 2018 to June 19$^{th}$ 2020. This dataset contains 366,405 crowd-generated labels (three labels per tweet) for 122,135 PASS-related tweets (out of 1,902,980,841 tweets), labelled by 708 unique annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In addition to crowd-generated labels, this dataset provides details about the three critical components of any public health surveillance system, including place, time, and demographics (gender, age-range) associated with each tweet. I used machine learning, latent semantic analysis, linguistic analysis, and label inference analysis to validate different components of the dataset. Moreover, I used narrative visualizations to complement the inference methods provided for generating and interpreting different data records of the dataset.

## Digital Public Health Surveillance (DPHS)

In this research, I utilized natural language processing, qualitative analysis, and visualization techniques to consolidate and characterize the existing research on DPHS and identify areas for further research. In this research, we conducted a comprehensive systematic scoping review of 755 articles on DPHS published from 2005 to January 2020. The studies included in this review were from 54 countries and utilized 26 digital platforms to study 208 sub-categories of 49 categories associated with 16 public health surveillance (PHS) themes. In addition to discussing the potentials of using Internet-based data as an affordable and instantaneous resource for DPHS, this research also highlights the paucity of longitudinal studies and the methodological and inherent practical limitations underpinning the successful implementation of a DPHS system. Little work studied Internet usersâ€™ demographics when developing DPHS systems, and 39% (291) of studies did not stratify their results by geographic region. A clear methodology by which the results of DPHS can be linked to public health action has yet to be established, as only six (0.8%) studies deployed their system into a PHS context.  I also developed an [**interactive visual dashboard**] (https://rpubs.com/zshakeri/dphs_dashboard) to provide insights into the findings with a multidimensional and more granular conceptual structure that is difficult to articulate in text alone.
