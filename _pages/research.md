In this research, I developed a multicountry, longitudinal, and fully Labelled digital public health dataset of tweets that originated in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), or the United States (US) between November 28$^{th}$ 2018 to June 19$^{th}$ 2020. This dataset contains 366,405 crowd-generated labels (three labels per tweet) for 122,135 PASS-related tweets (out of 1,902,980,841 tweets), labelled by 708 unique annotators on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In addition to crowd-generated labels, this dataset provides details about the three critical components of any public health surveillance system, including place, time, and demographics (gender, age-range) associated with each tweet. I used machine learning, latent semantic analysis, linguistic analysis, and label inference analysis to validate different components of the dataset. Moreover, I used narrative visualizations to complement the inference methods provided for generating and interpreting different data records of the dataset.
